# My TOP Restaurants

My TOP Restaurants is my first project using react as the main tool. The site has the complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). In addition, bootstrap and CSS were used to style the site.
As this is my first React project, there is room for further edits, as it is not yet a final version.

As this is a project using only front end technology, no backend structure was used in its development.

The site basically consists of the possibility for the user to create, edit and save their collection of favorite restaurants.

The site can be tested [here](https://my-top-restaurants.netlify.app/)
